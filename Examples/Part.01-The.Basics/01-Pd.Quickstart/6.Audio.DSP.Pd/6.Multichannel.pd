#X text 38 308 The [inlet~] object deals with multichannel inputs \, so this means you can have abstractions that deal with multichannel signals and send multichannel signals to a [pd~] object as well. The [clone] object also handles multichannel input and has special flags to distribute the signals into different copies of the abstraction or merge the outputs of all copies into a multichannel output. Check its help file., f 62;
#X text 228 456 This tutorial is following the bleeding edge state of Pd development with a not yet released Pd 0.54 version \, which includes support for multichannel., f 29;
#X text 79 588 When it is a reality \, the [out~] abstraction is aware that there's a multichannel input and can distribute it to both outputs. It relies on the [nchs~] external from ELSE that reports the number of channels. Check its help file., f 54;
