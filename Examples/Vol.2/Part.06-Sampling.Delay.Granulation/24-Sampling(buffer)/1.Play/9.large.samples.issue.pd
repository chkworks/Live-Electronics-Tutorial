#X text 48 23 Pd currently has a limitation on idexing big tables because
of its 32-bit resolution. You can now compile Pd in 64 bits to overcome
this issue \, but most won't know how to do that and have to wait unltil
Pd is made readily available for download with 64 bits resolution.
Until then (which should be nearby anyway) \, beware of this limitation
when feeding indexes to [tabread4~] (or [tabplayer~] for that matter).
, f 63;
#X text 48 131 The reason this happens is because we a maximum integer
value that is possible with 32 bits might not be enough as an index
sample. Not only that \, but the decimal fraction can also lose precision.
For integers \, we have 2Ë†24 values and this is about 6:20 min of
audio in 44.1khz (less if sample rate is higher)., f 63;
#X text 48 210 Note this is just an issue if you're feeding [tabread4~]
or [tabplayer~] with audio signals to represent indexes. Actually \,
in a similar fashion \, [table~] (which has an index input from 0-1
also has issues) is not free from this issue as well. Anyway \, this
means that if [tabplay~] or [tabplayer~] are just reading through an
array on their own via control messages \, then it's fine., f 63;
#X text 48 315 Note \, however \, that [tabread4~] has a second inlet
to set an onset value and this is a hacky way for extending the precision
of the input indexes., f 63;

#X text 53 459 You can use check B15.tabread4~-onset.pd as part of
the Pd's audio examples to see how this works and also. Check also
the next example B16.long-varispeed.pd for a practical example on how
to use this to play long files with a signal input.;
#X text 52 537 This example is not so easy to understand \, but instead
of reproducing the example in this tutorial in a simpler way and trying
to deal with this \, I currently think is best just to wait until Pd
64 bits is more of a reality than it already is (be patient \, it's
just around the corner) so we can just forget about this. I might change
my mind and create a new example or abstraction to deal with this anyway.
