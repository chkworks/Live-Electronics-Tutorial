#X text 35 334 BLEP takes the BLIT idea further and produces a 'step
function' \, used as a transition table for discontinuities. The J09.bandlimited.pd
from Pd's audio examples is an implementation of BLEP. Poly BLEP uses
a polynomial instead of a table. ELSE offers some band-limited oscillators
based on the Poly BLEP algorithm., f 69;
#X text 35 20 There are many other contemporary algorithms proposed
to reduce the audible level of aliasing. Since a key aspect in generating
aliasing is discontinuity in waveforms \, be it via hard sync or plain
drastic jumps because of the waveform itself (like in square and sawtooth)
\, most of these techniques focuses on dealing with the discontinuities
in the edges of the synthesized waveforms. Famous examples of such
techniques are:, f 69;
#X text 35 211 The BLIT technique creates a stream of lowpass filtered
impulses \, a stream of sinc() functions that are integrated together
over time. Integrating unipolar BLITs results in a sawtooth wave with
a rounded discontinuity. Integrating bipolar BLITs results in a square
wave and doubly integrating bipolar BLITs results in a triangle wave.
BLIT oscillators feature a ringing on the band edges of the waveforms
and aliasing is reduced but not totally eliminated. BLITs can also
be computationally expensive and are often stored in wavetables.,
