#X text 547 13 MiniBLEP is an minimum-phase bandlimited step functio
PolyBLEP uses a polynomial instead of a table and is the most modern
version of the BLEP technique. ELSE offers some band-limited oscillators
based on the Poly BLEP algorithm.;
#X text 28 15 There are yet many algorithms to reduce the audible level
of aliasing. The key aspect in generating aliasing is discontinuity
in waveforms \, be it via hard sync or plain drastic jumps because
of the waveform itself (like in square and sawtooth) \, so they focus
on dealing with the discontinuities in the edges of the synthesized
waveforms. Famous examples of such techniques are:, f 70;
#X text 28 186 The 'BLIT' technique creates a stream of lowpass filtered
impulses as a stream of sinc functions (because the impulse response
of an ideal lowpass filter is a sinc function \, which is band-limited).
These impulses are often stored in wavetables and integrated together
over time. Integrating unipolar BLITs results in a sawtooth wave with
a rounded discontinuity. Integrating bipolar BLITs results in a square
wave and doubly integrating bipolar BLITs results in a triangle wave.
BLIT oscillators feature a ringing on the band edges of the waveforms
to reduce aliasing., f 70;
#X text 28 324 BLEP produces a 'step function' to deal with discontinuities.
One possibility is to use a transition table as in the J09.bandlimited.pd
ecample from Pd's audio examples. Instead of impulse trains \, miniBLEP
uses a minimum-phase bandlimited step function that eliminates lookahead
and integration like BLIT needs., f 70;
